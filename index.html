		<h3>About Us</h3>
			<p>Bubble Under is a group of diving enthusiasts based in the
				south-west UK who meet up for diving trips in the summer
				months when the weather is good and the bacon rolls are
				flowing. We arrange weekends away as small groups to cut the
				costs of accommodation and travel and to ensure that everyone
				gets a trustworthy dive buddy.</p>
			<p>Although we're based in the south-west, we don't stay on our
				own turf: past diving weekends away have included trips up to
				Scapa Flow in Scotland and to Malta's numerous wreck
				sites.</p>
			<p>When we're not diving, we often meet up in a local pub
				to talk about our recent adventures (any excuse, eh?).</p>
		<h3>Contact Us</h3>
